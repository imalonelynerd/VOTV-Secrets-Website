  <h1>Dreams</h1>
  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p id="3">
    Dreams are another mechanic in VOTV, while sleeping you will have a certain chance of getting a
    dream. When you do get a dream it usually is black and white, blurry, and the movement is very
    janky. Each dream has a time limit that when passed will trigger the player to go back to Main
    Base.
  </p>
  <p id="4">Each dream has certain tasks that you must complete.</p>
  <p id="5">
    When you successfully complete a dream you can earn alot more stamina and hunger, you can also
    grab and hold items from dreams allowing you to obtain extra props and items from the dreams
    back to wherever you wake up.
  </p>
  <p id="6">
    However, if you were to fail a dream it will result in you losing alot of either hunger or
    stamina.
  </p>
  <p id="7">
    All dreams usually spawn underneath the Main Base in the void, hence when the player either
    no-clips or falls off a dream it will result in a fail.

    However if you were to destroy any dream structure using destroy target command what would
    happen next is your world will be completely dark and have no lighting. And the screen will
    still be blurry as the dream minigame will be running continously until the timer is hit.
