  <h1>Objects</h1>
  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>
    Like entities, objects exist in the game, however these objects do not move, can be interacted,
    or are animated in some way. Instead they serve different purposes.

        A orange capsule with a gear shaped housing. Once you trigger the

        laser will charge up the machine and once the player gets too close it, it will unlock some

          The Ship Engine object is a Rozital object, it appears as though it has been lost,
          misplaced, or forgotten. The object serves as an important landmark for the
          <a href="../Signals/specialsigswiki.html#lifecrystal">Lifecrystal Signal</a>
          as the Rozital that we can observe is looking for the Ship Engine object.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once Rozital finds the object it eventually beams it and when the player encounters it,
          the object ultimately disappears or is destroyed. This is most likely the Rozitals
          ensuring no lost technology is left behind especially on one like Earth.

          To obtain the cyan one, you must put down 12 shrimp at the bottom of the base pool and use

        </p>
        <p>
          To obtain the magenta one, you must obtain the

        </p>
        <p>
          However you must not save it to your computer, from there go check the rocks near the
          <a>Ship Engine Object</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          To obtain the yellow one, you must place one shrimp at each fence corner and one shrimp in
          the center of the basement on top of the sewer. At the bottom of the basement, without
          looking in the direction of the center of the basement, wait till 00:00-1:00 am. This will
          be the time window for you to look and grab the yellow one.
        </p>

        <p>
          To obtain the gold one, you must find a golden ingot by digging and stare at it for an
          hour in real time.
        </p>

        <p>
          To obtain the black one, you are required to obtain all red, green, blue, cyan, yellow,
          and magenta <a href="#argplush">Argemia Plushies</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then you will need to find all 7 skulls to trigger the

        </p>
        <p>From there you will want to put all 6 plushies into your inventory.</p>
        <p>
          Stay far enough away where you can hold out against the pull of the wormhole but close
          enough that you can drop the plushies for them to be sucked in.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will trigger the
          <a href="../Events/triggerableeventswiki.html#hellopen">Hell Opening Event</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few seconds of the wormhole appearing, you will want to drop each of the plushies
          one by one until the wormhole eventually subsides and the black one is achieved.
        </p>

        <p>
          To obtain the white one, you are also required to obtain all 6 of the RGBCYM
          <a>Argemia Plushies</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there you must use an industrial 3d printer to 3D print a flat hexagon surface or
          object of 5m on each side and 10m across each point. Or you can also use a physics gun and
          a plastic bottle to scale the bottle and place it solidly. The scale you’d want to use for
          this is between 136-150. From there place each of the plushies in the corner of the
          hexagon.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do it correctly you will hear a loud wind sound and each of the plushies, one by
          one, will be shot with a colored laser of said plushie. After a few moments all 6 of them
          will disappear and the white one will appear from above. If you don’t get it right on the
          first try, attempt to inch and reposition the plushies more perfectly since this one
          requires insane precision.

        A spiral staircase that leads all the way down. But be warned when you enter a mysterious
        force will mess up your base and cause a huge mess to appear. The first part of the
        structure is very dark and you will hear a growl, then the second part is a very bright
        staircase with a light brown orangish overlay for each of the textures, then the third part
        will be the same except with a white overlay, and then the fourth part will have a light
        blue overlay but will have a barrier stopping you from going deeper. If you ragdoll or
        return home, you will be taken back to Main Base. The final part of the staircase is a small
        chamber with four chairs and a barred off pipe, going down this pipe reveals nothing and the
        player just falls off into the void. When it becomes dark the room turns kinda reddish. Do
        note that when it is night time or evening the spiral staircase will become very dark so
        when this happens, its best to simply stay in one spot and wait for it to get light again.

          The Brickwall appears to be representative of the object
          <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-087/">SCP-087</a> from the SCP Foundation
          Universe. Both objects have an infinite staircase that seemingly transcends downwards
          infinitely. The only difference being the brick wall itself and the small chamber located
          at the bottom which don't occur with the original SCP.

        A powerful tool that the player can use to patrol, write reports, fix servers, fix

        Erie1, Keljoy, Manny, Keith, Argemia, and Alien. With Erie1, Argemia, and Alien currently
        unobtainable but with their own sounds. Erie1 is Erie but with a skimpy outfit and can only
        be activated once, upon deactivating, the prop disappears. Keith is the default skin for all
        Kerfurs unless Funny Mode is turned on within game settings, if funny mode is turned on, you
        can still craft him by following the blueprint but don't add any colors or other props to
        change it's skin. To obtain the Erie and Keljoy variants you need to simply replace the
        Kerfus Colors with either the Erie Plush or the Kel Plush. To obtain Manny, you need to
        replace the 2 plastic scraps with wooden scraps and the Kerfus Color with the moving
        mannequin prop. If the player feeds a
        <a href="#lifecrystal">Lifecrystal Prop</a> to only the three colored Kerfurs, the Omega
        Kerfur will make distorted sounds, it'll light up a purple glow from its chest, and cannot
        be turned off. The omega kerfurs can be given clothes and wear them. Omega kerfurs can be
        broken by any explosion or hit. If broken, you can easily repair them by putting all their
        pieces on the crafting table and recrafting them.
